Codes and datasets for [Handling Distribution Shifts on Graphs: An Invariance Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02466).
This work focuses on distribution shifts on graph data and proposes a new approach ***Explore-to-Extrapolate Risk Minimization (EERM)*** for out-of-distribution generalization on graphs. 
In our experiment, we consider three types of distribution shifts on graphs

- Artificial Transformation

- Cross-Domain Transfer

- Temporal Evolution

More information will be updated.
